Demo 1: Simple Customer Support Agent - Knowledge Sharing Session
Use Case: E-commerce Customer Support Automation
Business Problem: An e-commerce company receives hundreds of customer inquiries daily about:

Order status and tracking
Product information and FAQs
Return/refund requests
General support issues
Solution: Build a simple AI agent that can handle common customer support tasks autonomously, reducing human workload and providing 24/7 support.

Agent Capabilities:

FAQ Search - Answer common questions from knowledge base
Order Lookup - Check order status and tracking information
Ticket Creation - Create support tickets for complex issues
Product Search - Find product information and availability
Key Learning Goals:

Understand basic AI agent architecture without frameworks
Learn function calling patterns with OpenAI
See manual tool orchestration and error handling
Foundation for comparing with framework implementations


Demo 2: Customer Support Agent with LangChain Framework
Use Case: E-commerce Support with Framework Power
Business Problem: The same e-commerce company needs customer support automation, but now we'll implement it using LangChain framework to demonstrate:

Framework Advantages:

70-80% Less Code: LangChain handles boilerplate automatically
Built-in Memory: Conversation context across interactions
Standardized Tools: Easy tool creation with proper syntax
Production Patterns: Battle-tested agent architecture
Advanced Features: Retry logic, error recovery, and more
Same Agent Capabilities (Now Framework-Powered):

FAQ Search - Answer common questions with smart matching
Order Lookup - Check orders with automatic validation
Ticket Creation - Create support tickets with auto-routing
Product Search - Find products with intelligent recommendations
Key Learning Goals:

Compare framework vs custom implementation
Understand LangChain's productivity benefits
Learn agent memory and conversation management
See how frameworks reduce development time and complexity
